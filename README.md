## 🔐 Authentication

### JWT Flow

```
1. User registers/logs in
   ↓
2. Auth Service returns access + refresh tokens
   ↓
3. Client sends requests with Bearer token
   ↓
4. Service validates with JWT strategy
```

### Protected Endpoints

All authenticated endpoints require:
```
Authorization: Bearer <access_token>
```

## 📡 Kafka Event Architecture

### Event Flow

```
User Registration
    ↓
Auth Service publishes "user-registered"
    ↓
Subscribers:
- Notifications Service (welcome email)
- Products Service (user preferences)
- Inventory Service (cart initialization)
```

## 🪵 Centralized Logging (ELK Stack)

- **Winston Logger** - Application logs
- **Logstash** - Log aggregation
- **Elasticsearch** - Log storage
- **Kibana** - Log visualization (http://localhost:5601)

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Services won't connect to Kafka
```bash
docker-compose logs kafka
# Verify: KAFKA_BROKERS=kafka:29092
```

### PostgreSQL connection fails
```bash
# Verify: DATABASE_HOST=postgres (not localhost)
docker-compose exec postgres psql -U ecommerce_user -d ecommerce_db
```

### Logs not in Kibana
```bash
docker-compose logs logstash
curl http://localhost:9200/_cat/indices
```

## 📝 Environment Variables

See [.env.example](.env.example):

```env
NODE_ENV=development
PORT=4001
DATABASE_HOST=postgres

DATABASE_USER=ecommerce_user
DATABASE_PASSWORD=ecommerce_password
DATABASE_NAME=ecommerce_db
KAFKA_BROKERS=kafka:29092

## Deployment

When you're ready to deploy your NestJS application to production, there are some key steps you can take to ensure it runs as efficiently as possible. Check out the [deployment documentation](https://docs.nestjs.com/deployment) for more information.

If you are looking for a cloud-based platform to deploy your NestJS application, check out [Mau](https://mau.nestjs.com), our official platform for deploying NestJS applications on AWS. Mau makes deployment straightforward and fast, requiring just a few simple steps:

```bash
$ yarn install -g @nestjs/mau
$ mau deploy
```

With Mau, you can deploy your application in just a few clicks, allowing you to focus on building features rather than managing infrastructure.
